      How've you been? It's been about <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months since we last talked.

      I just finished my first year of grad school and am in New York for the summer, learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy. I'm having a great time so far! This is an auto-generated email that I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations (the four week prep-work course that I've been working on this last month).

      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog.
